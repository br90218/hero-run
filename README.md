## About this game
> "For centuries the human race has been enslaved by gods from the higher realm. Under absolute power no rebellion has been ever attempted.

> Legend has it that in the far North, nigher above the highest mountains, hidden in the thick clouds lies an entrance to the heavens. Only through the 'Path' guarded by the Watchman can one understand the ultimate truth of this world.

> And now, a hero has arrived at the footsteps of heaven. He does not know what he will see behind those gates, but he is destined to become a legend."

"Hero, RUN!" is an **Asymmetric VR multiplayer game** where two players will take turns playing as the hero and the god. As the **hero**, your goal is to reach the heavenly gates as quickly as possible; as the **god**, however, you must deter your adversary from breaching into your realm at all cost.

## Installing the game
Please check out the releases page to find the latest build.

Unfortunately, bounded by the nature of this game you will need an insanely powerful setup to run this game. To be specific:
- HTC Vive with controllers
- A graphics card that spits hot fire (Test passed with GTX 1080 Ti)

You will also need a big room, where one player can play in the Vive while the other can be seated in front of the computer. **It is also strongly advised that your hardware setup allows the cables for the Vive to come out of the computer from a direction opposite from where the PC player is seated. Hardware casualties may occur if not done correctly.** 

This is not an online multiplayer game so you will only need one computer to execute the game.

## Running the game
Before running the game, please make sure that the Vive is up and running.


**Note:** There will be a screen in game where players will be asked to input their names. Before this stage is done no content will be displayed in the VR headset. Please put on your headset after you've completed this step.
