Welcome to the repository of "Hero, RUN!". Please check out the releases page for the latest build.

## About this game
> "For centuries the human race has been enslaved by gods from the higher realm. Under absolute power no rebellion has been ever attempted.

> Legend has it that in the far North, nigher above the highest mountains, hidden in the thick clouds lies an entrance to the heavens. Only through the 'Path' guarded by the Watchman can one understand the ultimate truth of this world.

> And now, a hero has arrived at the footsteps of heaven. He does not know what he will see behind those gates, but he is destined to become a legend."

"Hero, RUN!" is an **Asymmetric VR multiplayer game** where two players will take turns playing as the hero and the god. As the **hero**, your goal is to reach the heavenly gates as quickly as possible; as the **god**, however, you must deter your adversary from breaching into your realm at all cost.

## Installing
Please check out the releases page to find the latest build.

Unfortunately, bounded by the nature of this game you will need an insanely powerful setup to run this game. To be specific:
- HTC Vive with controllers
- A graphics card that spits hot fire (Test passed with GTX 1080 Ti)





- You might wonder why the name of this repository is different from the game's itself. Truth be told, we were working on something completely different, but we had to bail the idea for there is simply not enough time for us to fulfill it; but since we can start off with assets we've already created, there's no apparent reason for us to remove it entirely.
